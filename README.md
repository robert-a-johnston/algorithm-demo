# Algorithm Demo: A Description
Algorithm Demo is an application that lets a user see a visual representation of different
sorting and path finding algorithms.  The application also provides some information and links
to more information about each algorithm.
## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
- Clone this project.
- Run ``npm install`` to install dependencies.
- Run ``npm start`` to run development server.
## IMPORTANT LINKS
- [Algorithm Demo Deployed Link](https://robert-a-johnston.github.io/algorithm-demo/) 
## PLANNING STORY
The developer was working on understanding various algorithms for sorting and path finding.  
The developer decided to visually show how the algorithms work to better understand the various algorithms.
## USER STORIES
- The user should be able to select between sorting algorithms or path finding algorithms.
- The user should be able to create a random array of unsorted numbers.
- The user should be able to see what the random array looks like visually through the use of bars of different heights.
- The user should be able to select a specific algorithm to sort the unsorted array.
- The user should be able to set start and finish nodes on a graph.
- The user should be able to create walls on the graph.
- The user should be able to remove walls on the graph.
- The user should be able select an path finding algorithm to run which will show the shortest path.
- The user should be able to reset the graph to original state.
